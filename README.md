For my project I wanted to answer the question: what Mcdonald's drive-thrus are open in Florida at 3am?


I got the data from the following site:
https://data-m8.com/products/list-of-all-mcdonalds-locations-in-the-us-csv-and-json

I wanted to clean it and visualize it. 

View the data as an interactive map website here!
