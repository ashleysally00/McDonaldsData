For my project I wanted to answer the question: what Mcdonald's drive-thrus are open in Florida at 3am?

https://data-m8.com/products/list-of-all-mcdonalds-locations-in-the-us-csv-and-json
* not sure what happened, but it looks like it is no longer free, sry

I wanted to learn to clean the data and visualize it. 
ChatGPT suggested I use folium and geoPandas:
That worked.

View the data as an interactive map website here!
